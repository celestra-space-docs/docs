## Introduction

Convolutional coding is a type of error-correcting code that plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity of data transmitted across the vast distances of space. This article delves into the key aspects of convolutional coding used in space communications, covering its encoding and decoding algorithms, the Viterbi algorithm, and its application in signal processing architecture.

Convolutional codes are generated by passing the binary data through a shift register and then linearly combining the register contents to produce the coded output. These codes are specified by three main parameters:
- **Constraint length (K)**: The length of the shift register, indicating how many bits of past input are used to encode the current output.
- **Code rate (R)**: The ratio of input bits to output bits, usually denoted as $$ R = \frac{k}{n} $$, where $$ k $$ is the number of input bits and $$ n $$ is the number of output bits per input bit.
- **Polynomials**: These define how the inputs are mixed in the shift register to produce the output.


## Encoder Algorithm

The encoder for a convolutional code is relatively simple, consisting of a series of shift registers and modulo-2 adders. The encoder processes the input bits serially and shifts them through the registers, generating several outputs at each step through the adders.

Here is a simple pseudocode for a basic convolutional encoder:

```python
Initialize shift registers to zero
for each input bit:
    shift registers = [input bit] + shift registers[:-1]
    output bits = compute outputs from current register values using modulo-2 addition
    send output bits
```

This encoder configuration depends on the generator polynomials chosen, which define how input bits influence the output bits.

## Decoder Algorithm

Decoding convolutional codes, especially in noisy environments, can be more complex than encoding. The decoder attempts to reconstruct the original data sequence by considering various possible input sequences and selecting the most likely one.

A preferred approach for decoding is the Viterbi algorithm, but here's a basic outline of a generic decoder:

```python
Initialize a decoder state based on expected length of the received bit stream
for each received bit pair:
    update decoder state based on the likelihood of transitions
    store the most likely paths
return the path with the highest likelihood as the output
```

## Viterbi Algorithm

The Viterbi algorithm is the most widely used decoding technique for convolutional codes, particularly in the context of space communications. It uses dynamic programming to determine the most likely sequence of hidden states (in this case, encoder states) that results in the observed sequence of outputs.

### Pseudocode for the Viterbi Algorithm

```python
Initialize path metrics for each state
for each received bit:
    for each state:
        calculate path metrics from previous states
        retain the path with the highest metric
    normalize metrics to prevent overflow
backtrack from final state to retrieve the most likely transmitted data
```


## Example Signal Processing Architecture

In space applications, the signal processing architecture incorporating convolutional coding generally includes both hardware and software components designed to optimize performance and efficiency under constrained conditions. The architecture typically consists of:

1. **Input Interface**: Receives the raw data from sensors or other sources.
2. **Analog-to-Digital Converters**: Convert the analog signals to digital form.
3. **Encoders**: Apply convolutional coding to the digital data.
4. **Modulators**: Prepare the coded data for transmission.
5. **Transmitters**: Send the data to Earth or other spacecraft.
6. **Receivers**: Capture incoming transmissions.
7. **Demodulators**: Extract the coded data from the received signal.
8. **Decoders**: Employ algorithms like the Viterbi algorithm to decode the data.
9. **Output Interface**: Delivers the decoded data to the onboard systems or storage units.

This architecture ensures robust data handling and error correction, which are essential for the reliability and success of space missions. Convolutional coding, with its robust error correction capabilities, remains a cornerstone of modern space communication systems.
