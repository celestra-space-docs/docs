Error responses are always JSON-encoded, regardless of
the request's Content-Type, with a corresponding
`Content-Type: application/json` header. This ensures that
the errors are human-readable in any setting.

Errors are a JSON object with the keys:

- **code**: One of the error codes as a string.
- **msg**: A human-readable message describing the error
  as a string.
- **meta**: (optional) An object with string values holding
  arbitrary additional metadata describing the error.

Example:

```json
{
  "code": "internal",
  "msg": "Something went wrong"
}
```

Example with metadata:

```json
{
  "code": "permission_denied",
  "msg": "Thou shall not pass",
  "meta": {
    "target": "Balrog",
    "power": "999"
  }
}
```
