## Tenant Isolation

Celestra provides robust tunable tenant isolation across its services:

- Siloed Isolation: Allocating dedicated resources exclusively to each tenant.
- Pooled Isolation: Sharing resources among multiple tenants.
- While we do not offer complete siloed environments, tenants can tune isolation levels per service.

## Access Management

Our system ensures secure access management:

- Individual Tenant Credentials: Unique credentials are issued for each tenant.
- Tenant Switching: Accessing different tenants requires new, separate credentials.

## Data Segregation and Encryption

In pooled resources:

- Primary Key Inclusion: Tenant ID is incorporated as part of the primary key for data segregation.

## Monitoring and Logging

Our monitoring and logging are designed to respect tenant privacy:

- Anonymized Logs: Logs are devoid of tenant-specific information to ensure privacy.

## Resource and Performance Isolation

To maintain service quality:

- Throttling: Resource consumption is monitored and throttled to prevent excessive use by any tenant.

## Tenant Data Backup and Restoration

Data resiliency is a priority:

- Global Backup: Tenant data backups are stored encrypted across multiple continents for enhanced reliability and accessibility.

## Data Protection and Privacy

Data security is paramount:

- Encryption: All data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.

## Access Control

Our API access control uses industry established methods:

- HMAC Authentication: Machine to machine requests are authenticated using HMAC.
- Phantom Token: Mainly used by the Cloud API for interactions with the Celestra web application.

## Compliance and Auditing

Celestra is committed to maintaining high standards of compliance and auditing in line with various legal and industrial frameworks. Our compliance efforts include:

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Ensuring user data protection and privacy in accordance with EU laws.
- Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP): Adherence to standardized approach for security assessment and authorization.
- CIS Benchmark: Implementing best practices for secure configuration.
- Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) STAR Self-Assessment: Conducting self-assessments to ensure security and privacy controls.
- AWS Well-Architected Framework: Aligning with AWS's principles for building secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure.
