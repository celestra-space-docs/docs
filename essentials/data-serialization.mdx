title: "Data Serialization"
description: "Celestra Space provides a robust and versatile API designed to cater to diverse application needs, leveraging the efficiency and structure of both JSON and Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for data serialization. This document outlines how to interact with the Celestras Space API via HTTPS POST Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)."
---

The API supports two serialization formats: JSON, for its simplicity and readability, and Protobuf, for its efficiency and compactness, catering to varying application requirements and network conditions.

## Best Practices

- Use Protobuf for high-performance applications requiring minimal bandwidth and low latency.
- Use JSON for applications where developer productivity and readability of payloads are more critical than performance.
