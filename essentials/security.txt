- Tenant Isolation
  - Celestra offers two isolation layers for each service.
    - Siloed means resources are dedicated to a tenant.
    - Pooled means resources are shared by tenants.
  - Celestra does not offer full stack silo/dedicated environments, instead it is tunable per service
- Access Management
  - Credentials to each tenant are issued on a per tenant basis
  - Switching active tenant requires separate new credentials.
- Data Segregation and Encryption
  - For pooled resources the tenant ID is part of the primary key.
- Monitoring and Logging
  - Logs do not contain tenant specific information
- Resource and Performance Isolation
  - Each tenant has throttling applied if too much resources are consumed.
- Tenant Data Backup and Restoration
  - Backup is stored on several continents.
- Data Protection and Privacy
  - All data is encrypted at rest and encrypted in flight.
- Access Control
  - API Authentication
    - HMAC
      - Provided and used by the SDK

      - Secret is either a secret key or phantom token (allows for not sending the token over the network)
    - Phantom token
