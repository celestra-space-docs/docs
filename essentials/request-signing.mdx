## Process for Signing requests with StarSign

<Steps>
  <Step title="Calculate hash of HTTP Request Body">
    The digest algoritm to use is version specific. As of version 1 it is SHA256. The hash of the body are computed and compared "as-sent" and "as-recieved" which means there are no canonicalization of the body. Encoding must be UTF-8.

    $$\text{hash}(\text{RequestBody})$$

  </Step>
  <Step title="Build signature payload">
    The payload is the string to be signed. It uses URL Encoding as representation with all values percent encoded. See [payload specification](#signature-payload-parameters). Example payload:

    ```
    a=hmac-sha256&
    d=GMuuPsaA4rCsGeMa56Ew4nu4ED79jkQ9kKS8UDUHYFv1&
    id=clientID&
    n=ETmr2tEpx691VS&
    u=v1.SpaceParameterService%2FDescribeParameter&
    t=20060102T150405Z
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Compute HMAC signature">
    Compute the HMAC hash of the payload using the Client Secret.

    $$\text{signature} = \text{HMAC}(secret, payload)$$

  </Step>
  <Step title="Format Authorization header">
    Format the Authorization header. Base58 encode the HMAC hash and the payload using the BTC alphabet. The HeaderKey is version specific, as of version 1 it is `starsign1`.

    $$\small\text{HeaderKey} \ || \ \text{' ' (space)} \ || \ \text{Base58}(\text{signature}) \ || \ \text{';'} \ || \ \text{Base58}(\text{payload})$$

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Authorization header to request and send it">
    ```
    Authorization: starsign1 3CAR2hUPT9[...];wMX3EtvWaZ[...]
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Signature Payload Parameters

The signature payload is metadata that gets signed and sent with the signature hash.

<ParamField query="a" type="string" required>
  HMAC **algoritm** constant is version specific, as of version 1 it is
  `hmac-sha256`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="n" type="base58(BTC) encoded hash" required>
  **Nonce** must be at least 16 bytes and at most the same length as the client
  secret. Requests that reuse a previous nonce are denied.
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="u" type="URL Path" required>
  **URL** Path of the request with any leading slash trimmed. Example
  `v1.SpaceParameterService/DescribeParameter`
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="t" type="datetime" required>
  **Time** of signing the request. Time format is ISO 8601 (20060102T150405Z).
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="d" type="base58(BTC) encoded hash">
  Hash **digest** value of the HTTP body. The digest algoritm is version
  specific, as of version 1 it is SHA256.
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="b" type="datetime">
  The request is valid until and **before** the specified time. Time format is
  ISO 8601 (20060102T150405Z)
</ParamField>

## Extending validity of requests

The StarSign signature scheme allows for setting a payload field named `b` for Before. It allows for extending the request validity into the future.
