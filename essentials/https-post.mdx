description: "This document outlines how to interact with the Celestra Space API via HTTPS POST JSON RPC."

## Overview

HTTPS-POST RPC allows clients to securely execute predefined operations on a server by sending HTTP POST requests over HTTPS.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure all systems are equipped with valid SSL/TLS certificate chains to establish a secure HTTPS connection.

## Data Serialization

The API supports two serialization formats: JSON, for its simplicity and readability, and Protobuf, for its efficiency and compactness, catering to varying application requirements and network conditions. [Learn more](/essentials/data-serialization).

## Example

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.celestra.space/v1.SpaceParameterService/CreateParameter \
  --header 'Authorization: <authorization>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "alias": "<string>"
  }'
```
